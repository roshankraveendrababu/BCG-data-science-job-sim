# Customer Churn Prediction


This repository contains all the code and solutions developed during the BCG Data Science Job Simulation. The project focuses on customer attrition analysis, which is crucial for businesses like telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services. These industries use customer attrition rates as a key business metric because retaining an existing customer is far more cost-effective than acquiring a new one.

In this project, I aim to perform customer survival analysis and build a model to predict customer churn. This involves using exploratory data analysis (EDA), pandas, and a random forest classifier which is one of the most efficient machine learning algorithm for this task. The goal is not just to predict which customers are at risk of leaving, but also to understand the reasons behind their potential departure.
